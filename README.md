Microfrontends with Astro
npm create astro@latest -- --template framework-multiple

This example showcases Astro's built-in support for multiple frameworks (React, Preact, Svelte, and Vue (v3.x)).

No configuration is needed to enable these frameworksâ€”just start writing components in src/components.
